into a wet mess of red.

The blood streams in rivulets
down your body, it sloshes in your shoes.

Your little engine heart flutters and kicks,
and with each frightened beat,
your breath quickens.

The target pool of blood grows around you
it thickens, and darkens in the raw air.
A steaming, iron smell rises.
But you notice none of this.

You do notice the terrible chill
of your hind-brain gasping in horror.
Its psychic-scream is cut short.

Meekly, you touch a cold finger
to your salty, pale lips
as the color begins to drain from the world.

And you collapse. </span>

A scarlet gardener - wasteful and merry
using up your every drop of fallow land.

Your wild-drum heart keeps you standing,
keeps you clutching at your wounds,
but already you feel your grip start to slacken.

As blood leeks out through your pressed fingers,
so too does your consciousness leek out
of your failing grasp on reality.

You try to draw your mind away
from the red-gold spilling at you feet
- and back to the hand you've been dealt.
How do we play these cards,
and still wake up tomorrow?

But your vision has become a pinpoint,
and your body topples back in freefall.

One last straw, too much for your poor heart.

Its marching trot becomes a panicked gallop,
an arrhythmia sending staccato stabs of pain.

Your hand gropes at your chest, as if to
massage the blood back into your veins,
or squeeze a fresh batch from your marrow.

But a wave of exhaustion crashes into your mind,
you are tossed, bobbing in dark, choppy waters.

A rising panic becomes a tumbling resignation.
Tachycardia to Bradycardia.
Your 'will' draining out of you like all other fluids.

Blinking, you peer down to survey your enemy,

A look of steel defiance.

You pull back, eyes darting,
head snapping, hairs on your nape erect.
A distant siren rings in you mind
like the gong of the apocalypse.

What are you doing?!
You fucked up. You fucked up BIG.

You break off into a crouching run,
shoes squeaking, heart in a fluttery panic.

You have a while until the regret sets in.

Minutes ago you traded fine fingers

despicable crooked digits and cracked nails.

What kind of worship leaves the temple this way?

You expectorate blood from your mouth,

Your honor crunches beneath you feet like glass.
The shards of your decency digging their way
into the dirty flesh of your sole.

A nausea grows slowly inside, not to be

Part of you know it's not true -
bruised, yes, and you will ache tomorrow.
But that little voice
is engulfed by monochrome flame.

In a few hours, you will wonder what happened,
where it was that your mind went.

But right now, you are <i>there</i>.
Right now, you can never leave.
'You are going to die. You are dead.' </span>

Your mind reels, gripping itself tightly.
Thoughts orbit and crash into eachother,
Strategy, proprioception, and instinct
topple out of your reach,

'Keep it together.' part of you says.
'Fuck you.' responds the rest.

And with that declaration,
the fighting spirit within you deflates.
It rolls of the table, and explodes
into glittering shards.

Your reasoning becomes a madhouse highway:
idle-musings plow headlong into somatic-alarms,
egoistic-shame T-bones self-preservation.
A hundred perceptions, notions, and convictions
piled high into a burning pyre.

You've kept it locked up so far,

A moment of lost focus, an instant

Roaring thunders in your ears,

It drags its claws across the backs of your eyes.

You stood on the ledge too long,
looking down into the abyss.
Now your mind if tipping, teetering, toppling.
You cast a hand out: to courage, to rationality

Perhaps cajoling panic back into its cage.
Perhaps dead under its paw.

Derealization lies below,

Up your leg, under your pants. Within you.

            <span class='loss card-desc'>The taste is familiar. Concentrated sweat.
The zinc flavor of adrenal,
and the iron of fresh blood.
A spoonful of parotid enzymes
(and a tingling sensation under the jaw).

There you are, on the side road.
Eight years old? Nine?
Dappled sunlight on your road-rash knees,
a crack in your helmet
<i>("oh thank god, you were wearing it!)</i>,
and a purpled lip for school pictures.

Mom is not far away - but she isn't here yet.
Its just you, and the pain, and the flavor,
and golden rays of sunlight.
Photons are born and die in the same instant.
And that was many years ago.

Do zinc and iron form an alloy?
I don't know if they do...

A million miles away,
your bruised body rolls on the pavement
a battered bunker, for a hideaway mind. </span>

you swipe your gaze directly over the sun.

In the center of your vision, a technicolor smudge
grows and dances:
your cones raving to exhaustion,
your rods drowning in the noise.

The photopsia elongates and grows,
a searing white blindfold thrust upon you.
You snap your head to and fro, trying to
shake materiality back to sharp vision.
It doesn't work.

Your ears strain to rush you pertinent data
-it flows excessive, with scant context.
You can't make sense of anything.

Your hated opponent no longer exists,
and neither does the world
- swallowed equally by the white void. </span>

Damn it! Don't loose track of them!

You brain buzzes with excess electricity,
as if arcs of plasma leap from your
cranium to graymatter,
blackening the neurons they touch.

Your psyche is stretched thin, worked, and folded,
like boardwalk taffy. Your vision warps and blurs.

Though it all, fear cuts like a hot knife.
It wills you to clarity.
It hacks, chops away at the confusion.

The terror is overzealous
in its need for your attention,
it is auto-immune, feverish.
The fright demolishes your last mental link
to terra firma.

landing on your arse,
kicking futilely to gain some distance.

Your breath is hot and forceful,
flapping your dry lips.
Your shoulders ache, and the pain
is mirrored in the hollow of your heart.

You try to form some resolute words,
but your ragged breath keeps cutting through.

Weakly, you raise a palm,
as if blocking your eyes from the light.
Weakness drags you down,
the heavy cords of gravity
anchoring you to the asphalt.

Your dull lead gaze returns to the
spittle spattered pavement before you.
You heavy breathing rocks you gently,
and the lullaby of you foamy gasps
cradles you to sleep. </span>

the 'chi' streaming like warm piss
down your pits, up your thighs,

It sloshes nauseatingly. Your abs squirm:
contractions giving birth to a desperate collapse.

A wave of cold runs up your genitals,
washing over the whirlpool in your belly.

Acid burping drags razors along your esophagus,
and singes your nostril hairs.
You press your eyes shut, gird your teeth
- but you know it is too late.

The chain-retching threatens to knock your
adams-apple free. To tie your larynx in a knot.

You puke. And puke and puke.
You snap your head to and fro,
stupidly trying to point it somewhere.
But instead of somewhere it goes everywhere.

Cramp. Cramp!

A corrosive, yellow pain twangs and twists

as if taunt tendons will snap your bones,
like an overworked crossbow.

Perhaps flexing will help...
Do you dare?

Of course you do, and the instant
shooting, searing, insufferable pain
debilitates you
with a swiftness no punch could match.

You writhe and yelp with a strange rhythm,
arms flapping, lips curling back.
Like a rusted piece of clockwork,

        <h1> Backstreet Brawl </h1>
        Whatever was said, it doesn't matter now.
        What matters is throwing fists. And winning.

        <h2> Start </h2>
        Each player gets their 8 Loss cards, one of each type, and lays them face down infront of them. Place a d6, with the '6' upwards, on the back of each Loss card. This is your current health, how much blood you have, how much oxygen, etc. Ensure they are visible to all.

        Each player draws 9 action cards.
        Place your figure in the stand, upright.
        (You can have their hands/arms however you like)
        Lay out the rule-reminder cards (Keep Breathing, Switch Grip, etc)

        Whichever player has a bigger bruise goes first.
        If neither is bruised, whoever bled last.

        <h2> Turns </h2>
        On your turn, you will:
        * Make as many


        <h3> At the start of your turn: </h3>
        <ul>
            draw cards until you have 9.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Check <b>Keep Breathing</b> to see how much stamina/focus you recover.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            if you are airborne, move yourself downwards until some part of you touches the ground.
        </ul>
        You can, however, be airborne during and at the end of your turn (and thus during your opponents turn).

        During your turn, you play as many cards as you like, and can simply discard any you don't want.

        If you have a <b> Reaction </b> card, you can play it during your opponents turn. They may require you to see if you can move a limb to block - you still have to spend stamina on this. If you can't complete that requirement, move the limb you tried back to where it was, and put the reaction back in your hand.

        You can be in multiple stances at once, e.g.: a low squat could be 'crouching' or 'sitting'.
        This means you can play cards that apply to either.
        (For something like 'Keep Breathing', you can choose the better stance, but not stack multiple.)

        (If you are playing against multiple opponents, and play a psych out or other card without an obvious target, you can choose.)
