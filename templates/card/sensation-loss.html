            <span class='loss card-desc'>The taste is familiar. Concentrated sweat.
The zinc flavor of adrenal,
and the iron of fresh blood.
A spoonful of parotid enzymes
(and a tingling sensation under the jaw).

There you are, on the side road.
Eight years old? Nine?
Dappled sunlight on your road-rash knees,
a crack in your helmet
<i>("oh thank god, you were wearing it!)</i>,
and a purpled lip for school pictures.

Mom is not far away - but she isn't here yet.
Its just you, and the pain, and the flavor,
and golden rays of sunlight.
Photons are born and die in the same instant.
And that was many years ago.

Do zinc and iron form an alloy?
I don't know if they do...

A million miles away,
your bruised body rolls on the pavement
a battered bunker, for a hideaway mind. </span>
